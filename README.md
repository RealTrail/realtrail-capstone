## Description
RealTrail is a fitness activity website used for outdoor activities centered around trail routes such as walking, running, hiking, or cycling. RealTrail allows users to create events and connect with other users allowing the ease of group activity scheduling. All users can participate in an event and have the ability to share their experiences by adding trail photos, ratings, post comments, or provide route information.

        'Salado Creek Greenway offers 19 miles of paved trail along San Antonio''s east side. Although the trail is still under development, its three completed segments (listed below, north to south) offer connections to many parks and neighborhoods.
Segment 1: Huebner Road to West Avenue

This northernmost segment is about 5 miles long and one of the trail''s most scenic. The pathway traces the Salado Creek through bluffs and hardwood forest. A highlight of the route is Voelcker farmstead, an archaeological site and historic set of buildings situated in Phil Hardberger Park. Named after a former San Antonio mayor, the park is an urban green oasis with native grasses and heritage oaks.

The trail continues to another worthwhile attraction, Walker Ranch Historic Landmark Park, which offers beautiful natural landscapes, picnic areas, a large pavilion, restrooms, and a playground.

To continue east on the greenway, passing Walker Ranch Park, take a left at the fork as you approach the park. This will keep you on the northern edge of the historical park. There will be another fork as you approach the main parking area of Walker Ranch. Again, stay to the left at the fork. This will keep you on the Salado Creek Greenway and take you under West Avenue and across North Loop Road to the temporary end (as of Sept. 2014) of this segment at US Highway 281.

Segment 2: McAllister Park to James Park

This middle segment is about 6.5 miles long. Its northern end offers a hilltop view of the city skyline and airport. The path traverses over a scenic wetland area with the Morningstar Boardwalk, named in memory of Army Staff Sergeant Christopher Morningstar, and continues through dense woodlands.

About two miles south of McAllister Park, a spur will take you to Lady Bird Johnson Park, a community favorite with a swimming pool, skate park, softball and soccer fields, and basketball courts. Farther south the trails runs through Los Patios, a shopping and dining area, before heading under Loop 410.

On the other side of the busy roadway, the pathway offers a well-shaded retreat under towering pecan and oak trees as it winds through Robert L.B. Tobin Park. The park is a terrific spot for bird-watchers; you may see warblers, buntings, hawks, owls, and many other types of birds. It also offers unique faux bois art in its signage, picnic tables, and benches. The trail ends at John James Park, named for a surveyor who helped establish the city''s boundaries in 1846. The park offers athletic fields, a playground, and restrooms.

Segment 3: Jack White Park to South Side Lions Park

Stretching about 7.5 miles, this is the trailâ€™s longest and southernmost section. It begins in Jack White Park on the north side of I-35 and winds south through Pletz County Park, Martin Luther King Park, Comanche Park, and South Side Lions Park, offering the traveler many amenities and picturesque views of the forest and creek.'),

        The word mission usually connotes religion. It''s true that San Antonio''s missions revolved around religion and faith, but it doesn''t describe the importance or full scope for any of them. Though intentionally created to spread the Catholic faith, missions are not churches. The church is merely one building among several in any mission. Each complex served as a separate, unique community.

All four churches (Mission Concepcin''s, Mission San Jose''s, Mission San Juan Capistrano''s, and Mission Espada''s) have active Catholic congregations. Though the congregations haven''t been continuously active since the 1700s, many of today''s members are direct descendants of the Indians who built the churches.

In addition to the families, the missions served as the foundation for much of what youâ€™â€™ll see in Texas today. The architecture, food, culture, textiles, and more all began in the missions in one way or another. Each is different and several served as important sites during the Texas Revolution.

When you visit the missions, be careful. These are historic structures and the masonry may not be able to hold your weight (such as if you decide to try and walk atop a retaining wall). Also, some structures may not be accessible due to restoration work or otherwise.'),
